How to configure you Web server for Depo
========================================

If you have apache, this package should already have done a
good job by installing the default Depo configuration file as:

	/etc/httpd/conf.d/depo.conf

Now, you probably want to change the default to prevent people
from accessing your Depo website, or because you have another
domain-name or simply because you don't want the generic
/depo/-Alias.

The config file provided is just a default that helps to set
up your initial environment and it is there to be adapted.
It uses by default the hostname 'depo' and if you define 'depo'
as a name on your local network, it may work without change.

For browsing and remote network installations via HTTP the
webserver can be accessed at:

	http://localhost/depo/
or
	http://depo/

If you want to enable HTTP authentication to prevent people
accessing your Depo repository, look at

	/etc/httpd/conf.d/depo.conf

And adapt to your needs. More information about HTTP
authentication and Apache can be found at:

	http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/howto/auth.html

Of course, to make it work you need to start Apache
by doing eg:

	service httpd start
