How to make Depo more (or less) verbose
=======================================

Depo has 2 options to influence what it prints.

  -q, --quiet           minimal output
  -v, --verbose         increase verbosity
  -vv, -vvv, -vvvv..    increase verbosity more

To make Depo only print essential messages (but be quiet when everything
is ok), use -q/--quiet

To make Depo report more about what it is doing, you can provide -v multiple
times. Here's what it means:

	options		level	description
	"""""""		"""""	"""""""""""
	-q		0	be quiet if no problems
	(no options)	1	print depo progress (normal)
	-v		2	print depo progress (detailed)
	-vv		3	print depo progress (detailed) + print helper-program output (normal)
	-vvv		4	print depo progress (detailed) + print helper-program output (detailed)
	-vvvv		5	print depo progress (debug)    + print helper-program output (detailed)
	-vvvvv		6	print depo progress (debug)    + print helper-program output (debug)

Not all helper-programs have options to increase verbosity or enable debugging.

Currently it is not possible to have Depo (or its tools) print out what files
are new and what files have been deleted. It's hard to do this tool-independent,
though there are other implementations that are possible (inotify,
directory-listing).

Rsync has specific options for allowing this, check the rsync manual and use
the rsync-options directive to add options.
