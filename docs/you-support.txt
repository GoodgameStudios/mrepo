// Please send me improvements to this document.

This document describes how to set up a Yast Online Update mirror for
various Novell/SUSE distributions and architectures.

== Requirements
The youget python script needs cElementTree support.


== Novell update credentials for NLD9 (and alike)
To be able to download updates from update.novell.com you need to copy the
files _/etc/ximian/mcookie_ and _/etc/ximian/partnernet_ from a registered
system to your +$srcdir/$dist-$arch/+ directory.

So for NLD9, you would have eg:

    /var/mrepo/nld9-i586/mcookie
    /var/mrepo/nld9-i586/partnernet

These are used by youget to authenticate with the YOU server.


== Novell update credentials for SLES10 (and alike)
To be able to download updates from nu.novell.com you need to copy the
files _/etc/zmd/deviceid_ and _/etc/zmd/secret_ from a registered
system to your +$srcdir/$dist-$arch/+ directory.

So for SLES10, you would have eg:

    /var/mrepo/sles10-x86_64/deviceid
    /var/mrepo/sles10-x86_64/secret

These are used by youget to authenticate with the YOU server.


== YOU configuration
Having done that, you can enable multiple channels for these credentials by
adding a configuration like the one below:

----
[nld9]
name = Novell Linux Desktop $release SP3 ($arch)
release = 9
arch = i586
iso = NLD$release-SP3-$arch-CD?.iso
updates = you://update.novell.com/data/$RCE/nld9/getPackage/nld-9-$arch/
extras = you://update.novell.com/data/$RCE/nld9-extras/getPackage/nld-9-$arch/
sdk = you://update.novell.com/data/$RCE/nld9-sdk/getPackage/nld-9-$arch/
----

or

----
[sles10]
name = SuSE Linux Enterprise Server $release SP1 ($arch)
release = 10
arch = i586 ia64 ppc s390x x86_64
iso = SLES-$release-SP1-$arch-CD?.iso SLES-$release-SP1-$arch-DVD?.iso
updates = you://update.novell.com/repo/$RCE/SLES10-Updates/sles-10-$arch/
sdk = you://update.novell.com/repo/$RCE/SLE10-SDK-Updates/sles-10-$arch/
----

After that, mrepo should be able to successfully log on and download
all packages for the configured channels.
