= Using YOU (Yast Online Update) support in mrepo

// Please send me improvements to this document.

This document describes how to set up a Yast Online Update mirror for
various Novell/SUSE distributions and architectures.

== Requirements
The youget python script needs cElementTree support.


== Novell update credentials
To be able to download updates from update.novell.com (or another YOU server)
you need to copy the files _/etc/ximian/mcookie_ and _/etc/ximian/partnernet_
from a registered/activated system to your +$srcdir/$dist-$arch/+ directory.

So for NLD9, you would have eg:

    /var/mrepo/nld9-i586/mcookie
    /var/mrepo/nld9-i586/partnernet

These are used by youget to authenticate with the YOU server.


== YOU configuration
Having done that, you can enable multiple channels for these credentials by
adding a configuration like the one below:

----
[nld9]
name = Novell Linux Desktop $release SP3 ($arch)
release = 9
arch = i386
iso = NLD$release-SP3-$arch-CD?.iso
updates = you://update.novell.com/data/$RCE/nld9/getPackage/nld-9-i586/
extras = you://update.novell.com/data/$RCE/nld9-extras/getPackage/nld-9-i586/
sdk = you://update.novell.com/data/$RCE/nld9-sdk/getPackage/nld-9-i586/
----

After that, mrepo should be able to successfully log on and download
all packages for the configured channels.
